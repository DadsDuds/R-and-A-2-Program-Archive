This project involves the use of hall sensors which are in charge of checking when an object has been moved.
The Braccio arm also had to be used to grab and move around objects (in this case, lego bricks).
Comes with a sleek GUI and some neat debugging notes in Python.
The magnet ino file was used to make sure all five hall sensors were working properly.
