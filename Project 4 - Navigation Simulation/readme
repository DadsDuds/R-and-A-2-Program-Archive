This project involves running a simulation in a grid world.
The goal is to have the player (robot) make its way to the goal (diamond) in four different ways.
The first is random, and the amount of moves the player has made is kept track.
The second uses a simple, but smarter, algorithm that lets the player reach the goal in as few moves as possible.
The third uses the smarter algorithm, but there's a 25% chance that the goal can move to a random position.
Lastly, the grid world is transformed into a nondeterministic world: 
  Each time the player makes a move, 85% of the time the robot will move in its intended direction.
  However, there is a 15% chance, which is then split thrice (5/5/5), that the robot will instead go to any other direction other than the intended one.
  Whilst this is happening, the goal has a 25% chance of moving to a random position.
